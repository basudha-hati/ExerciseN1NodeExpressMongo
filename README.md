The purpose of this project is to use **WebStorm** with Git and **Heroku** and create a **NodeJS+Express** project. We have used the **GitHub student's** account to set up a free account on Heroku and **MongoDB Atlas**. Then created new clusters and collection to add data. We have demonstrated the application working in a web browser and shown the Heroku console illustrating the app is deployed and a database console that shows the data in the database from the app working.
